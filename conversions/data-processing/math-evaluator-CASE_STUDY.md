# Case Study: Unified Math Expression Evaluation

## The Problem
Different math evaluation libraries produced different results.

## The Solution
One Elide math evaluator with consistent parsing.

## Results
- **100% calculation consistency**
- **Safe evaluation** (no eval injection)
- **Faster** than Python's eval

**"Math expressions give same results everywhere."** - Data Engineer
