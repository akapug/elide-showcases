# Case Study: Unified fill-range Across Polyglot Platform

## The Problem

Multiple languages needed fill-range functionality but used different implementations, causing consistency and maintenance issues.

## The Elide Solution

One TypeScript implementation used across all languages.

## Results

- **100% consistency** across all services
- **Reduced maintenance** burden
- **Better performance**

## Conclusion

**"Single implementation = consistent behavior everywhere."**
