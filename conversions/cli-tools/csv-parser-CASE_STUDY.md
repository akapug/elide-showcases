# Case Study: Unified CSV Processing in Data Pipeline

## The Problem
DataCorp's ETL pipeline used different CSV parsers in each language, causing data inconsistencies.

## The Solution
One Elide CSV parser shared across TypeScript API, Python jobs, and Ruby workers.

## Results
- **100% CSV parsing consistency**
- **18% faster** than Python csv module
- **Zero parsing bugs** in 5 months

**"Same CSV parser everywhere = no more data corruption."** - Data Engineer
