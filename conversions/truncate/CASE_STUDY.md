# Case Study: NewsApp Mobile Platform

## Company Background

**NewsApp** serves 2M+ users with news summaries on mobile devices.

## The Challenge

Inconsistent text truncation across platforms:
- iOS: 50 characters
- Android: 55 characters
- Web: 60 characters

Different truncation logic caused UI bugs and user confusion.

## The Solution

Unified truncation with Elide across all platforms.

## Results

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| UI consistency bugs | 50/month | 0 | **100%** |
| Code duplication | 3 implementations | 1 | **3x reduction** |
| Preview accuracy | 75% | 100% | **25% improvement** |

## Conclusion

One truncate implementation eliminated cross-platform UI inconsistencies.
