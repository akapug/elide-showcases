# Event-Driven Polyglot Architecture

Event sourcing and event-driven patterns implemented across multiple languages.

## Components

- **Event Store** (TypeScript): Append-only event log
- **Event Processor** (Python): Analytics and aggregations
- **Event Stream** (Go): High-throughput event streaming
- **Complex Event Processing** (Java): Pattern detection

## Running

```bash
elide run server.ts
```

## Patterns

- Event sourcing
- Event replay
- Real-time streaming
- Complex event processing
- Pattern detection
