VERDICT MATRIX - The 8 Problematic Showcases
================================================================================

1. VELOCITY (Bun Framework)
   ├─ Completeness: 40% ⚠️
   ├─ Realism: 30% ⚠️
   ├─ Has Code: YES (1,020 LOC core)
   ├─ Main Issues:
   │  ├─ Claims 1M+ req/sec with ZERO benchmarks
   │  ├─ Frames as "production framework" but is POC
   │  └─ Performance claims completely unproven
   └─ Recommendation: RELABEL → "Bun Performance Study"

2. ELIDE-BASE (Backend-in-a-File)
   ├─ Completeness: 50% ⚠️
   ├─ Realism: 40% ⚠️
   ├─ Has Code: YES (1,135 LOC API layer)
   ├─ Main Issues:
   │  ├─ Claims polyglot hooks (Python/Ruby/Java) NOT IMPLEMENTED
   │  ├─ No admin dashboard despite claims
   │  ├─ OAuth is stubbed
   │  └─ REST API is functional but promises exceed delivery
   └─ Recommendation: IMPROVE → implement promised features or remove

3. ELIDE-DB (Local-First Database)
   ├─ Completeness: 35% ⚠️
   ├─ Realism: 30% ⚠️
   ├─ Has Code: YES (14 code files)
   ├─ Main Issues:
   │  ├─ Claims CRDT conflict resolution NOT IMPLEMENTED
   │  ├─ Multi-device sync is NOT implemented
   │  ├─ Sync server is minimal skeleton
   │  └─ Query builder works but sync doesn't
   └─ Recommendation: RELABEL → "Local-first DB Framework (WIP)"

4. ELIDE-HTML (HTML + HTMX) ✓ APPROVED
   ├─ Completeness: 80% ✓
   ├─ Realism: 75% ✓
   ├─ Has Code: YES (15 code files)
   ├─ Main Strengths:
   │  ├─ HTMX integration actually works
   │  ├─ Component system is solid
   │  ├─ Form validation implemented
   │  └─ Good educational value
   ├─ Minor Issue:
   │  └─ <1ms performance claim lacks benchmarks
   └─ Recommendation: KEEP (add "performance is theoretical" note)

5. ELIDE-SUPABASE (Firebase Alternative)
   ├─ Completeness: 10% ⚠️
   ├─ Realism: 5% ⚠️
   ├─ Has Code: MOSTLY STUBS (26 code files = mostly empty interfaces)
   ├─ Main Issues:
   │  ├─ Claims Firebase/Supabase alternative - laughably incomplete
   │  ├─ No database code, no GraphQL, no auth, no storage code
   │  ├─ 90% directory structure, 5% actual implementation
   │  └─ Depends on non-existent "elide run" command
   └─ Recommendation: REMOVE (too misleading)

6. DEPLOY-PLATFORM (Vercel/Netlify Alternative)
   ├─ Completeness: 25% ⚠️
   ├─ Realism: 15% ⚠️
   ├─ Has Code: YES BUT STUBBED (13 code files, mostly skeleton)
   ├─ Main Issues:
   │  ├─ Claims deployment platform (massive scope)
   │  ├─ No git integration, no HTTPS/Let's Encrypt, no DNS
   │  ├─ Build pipeline is declared but not executable
   │  └─ 966 LOC API but APIs don't connect to anything
   └─ Recommendation: RELABEL → "Platform Architecture Reference (Educational)"

7. AI-CODE-GENERATOR (Like bolt.diy)
   ├─ Completeness: 35% ⚠️
   ├─ Realism: 25% ⚠️
   ├─ Has Code: YES (22 code files)
   ├─ Main Issues:
   │  ├─ Claims to generate code but MockAI returns dummy data
   │  ├─ No actual AI integration (requires external API)
   │  ├─ Transpilation is stub
   │  ├─ Live preview not implemented
   │  └─ "0ms vs 2+ seconds" comparison is misleading
   └─ Recommendation: RELABEL → "AI Framework (POC, requires API key)"

8. ML-API (Sentiment Analysis) ✓ APPROVED
   ├─ Completeness: 75% ✓
   ├─ Realism: 80% ✓
   ├─ Has Code: YES (9 code files, 440 LOC API)
   ├─ Main Strengths:
   │  ├─ Working TypeScript API server
   │  ├─ Real caching/rate limiting implementation
   │  ├─ Authentication system works
   │  ├─ Python ML setup included
   │  └─ Honest about limitations
   └─ Recommendation: KEEP (solid educational showcase)

SUMMARY STATISTICS
================================================================================

Total Analyzed: 8 showcases
  ✓ APPROVED TO KEEP: 2 (elide-html, ml-api)
  ⚠️ NEEDS RELABELING: 4 (velocity, elide-db, deploy-platform, ai-code-generator)
  🛑 SHOULD IMPROVE: 1 (elide-base)
  ❌ RECOMMEND REMOVAL: 1 (elide-supabase)

Code Implementation Status:
  - All have actual code files (not pure stubs)
  - Average completeness: 40%
  - Average realism: 40%

Common Problem Categories:
  1. Over-promising in README (8/8 showcases)
  2. Stub implementations (6/8 showcases)
  3. Performance claims without benchmarks (3/8 showcases)
  4. Unimplemented polyglot support (2/8 showcases)
  5. Unrealistic scope (2/8 showcases)
  6. Misleading positioning vs majors (2/8 showcases)

ACTION ITEMS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE:
  [ ] Remove or completely rewrite elide-supabase (too misleading)
  [ ] Add "WIP" disclaimers to velocity, elide-base, elide-db
  [ ] Update README descriptions to match actual code

SHORT TERM:
  [ ] Implement polyglot hooks in elide-base (major feature gap)
  [ ] Implement CRDT in elide-db or remove claim
  [ ] Add real benchmarks to velocity or remove performance claims
  [ ] Implement actual transpilation in ai-code-generator

OPTIONAL:
  [ ] Add disclaimer: "These are educational POCs, not production systems"
  [ ] Create matrix showing what actually works vs what doesn't
  [ ] Link to real projects for actual implementations
